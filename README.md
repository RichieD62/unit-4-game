This is the Crystal Collector Game. 

The user will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal, the user will add a specific amount of points to his/her total score. 

The user will win the game if he/she matches his/her total score to the random number. The user will lose the game if his/her total score goes above the random number. The vaue of each crystal is hidden from the user until he/she clicks on it. Each time the game starts, the game will change the value of each crystal.

Users can get started with the game by simply clicking on one of the gems near the bottom of the screen.

The biggest challenge I faced with was getting the program to reset once the win/lose condition was met. I created a reset function and put the function in the conditional win/lose statement and that yielded the result that I was looking for.
